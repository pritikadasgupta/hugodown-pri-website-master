[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) is an advent-style coding challenge, where there is a two-part coding/data challenge posted for each day in December until Christmas Day (December 1st to December 25th).

I will be attempting each day using R (mostly), Python (sometimes), and MATLAB (rarely) -- which are my three mainstay languages for data science.

[My github repository](https://github.com/pritikadasgupta/adventofcode) contains my solutions to Advent of Code 2019-2020!

Day 1: [Report Repair](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/1)
-----------------------------------------------------------

[My day 1 data](https://pritikadasgupta.github.io/post/advent-of-code-2020/data/exercise1.input.txt)

#### Part 1: Two numbers

The challenge is to find two numbers from a list that sum to 2020, then to report their product.

This post will be updated as I code/work through the rest of the challenges.
