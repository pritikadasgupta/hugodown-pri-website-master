event: 
event_url: https://events.vtools.ieee.org/m/240336

location: Zoom

summary: "For anyone doing research and preparing papers/talks/posters. This talk is intended to give an introduction and overview of the basic principles of Data Visualization. The core of the talk is learning what makes a visualization effective and expressive."

abstract: "During the research process, there inevitably comes a time when you must communicate your findings and ideas in the form of a paper, poster, or a talk. This talk will suggest possibilities of a visualization pipeline, by which scientists and researchers can create visual representations of their data. These possibilities will be based on industry practices, academic literature, and Pritika's personal experiences. Examples will be from the following domains: biological engineering, signal processing, machine learning, medicine, and public health."
